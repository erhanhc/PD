# PD Modelling of Composite Laminates for Damage Analysis
**Currently implementing the theory given in Peridynamic Theory and Its Application by Madenci and Oterkus** 
***Whats been done so far? ***
1. Ordinary state based PD formulation is studied following the given instructions/codes given in the refence book. 
2. ADR process is applied but not verified for quasi-static solutions. 
3. Pandas-HDF5 object and data formats are implemented using Ordinary state based formulation and isotropic material model. 

***TO-DO List***
1. Reformulation of the theory given in the reference book and its references. 
2. Verification and clear formulation of ADR process. Problems still exist in certain terms. 
3. Time integration schemes to be implemented in the code. 
4. Composite lamina and lamination theory to be studied, formulated and implemented in the code.
5. Damage prediction chapter to be studied, formulated and implemented in the code.
