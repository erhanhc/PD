abstractNote = {The application of peridynamics for engineering analysis requires an efficient and robust software implementation. Key elements include processing of the discretization, the proximity search for identification of pairwise interactions, evaluation of the con- stitutive model, application of a bond-damage law, and contact modeling. Additional requirements may arise from the choice of time integration scheme, for example esti- mation of the maximum stable time step for explicit schemes, and construction of the tangent stiffness matrix for many implicit approaches. This report summaries progress to date on the software implementation of the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics. Discussion is focused on parallel implementation of the meshfree discretization scheme of Silling and Askari [33] in three dimensions, although much of the discussion applies to computational peridynamics in general.},

The classical theory of solid mechanics is based on the assumption of a continuous distribution of mass within a body and all internal forces are contact forces that act across zero distance. The mathematical description of a solid that follows from these assumptions relies on PDEs that additionally assume sufficient smoothness of the deformation for the PDEs to make sense in their either strong or weak forms. The classical theory has been demonstrated to provide a good approximation to the response of real materials down to small length scales, particularly in single crystals, provided these assumptions are met. Nevertheless, technology increasingly involves the design and fabrication of devices at smaller and smaller length scales, even interatomic dimensions.}

abstract = {An alternative theory of solid mechanics, known as the peridynamic theory, formulates problems in terms of integral equations rather than partial differential equations. This theory assumes that particles in a continuum interact with each other across a finite distance, as in molecular dynamics. Damage is incorporated in the theory at the level of these two-particle interactions, so localization and fracture occur as a natural outgrowth of the equation of motion and constitutive models. A numerical method for solving dynamic problems within the peridynamic theory is described. Accuracy and numerical stability are discussed. Examples illustrate the properties of the method for modeling brittle dynamic crack growth.}
